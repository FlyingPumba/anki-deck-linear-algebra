# Linear Algebra

Anki flashcards for linear algebra, designed with mechanistic interpretability applications in mind.

## Curriculum Structure

### Part 1: Geometric Intuition (3Blue1Brown)
Lessons 1-16 follow 3Blue1Brown's "Essence of Linear Algebra" series:
- Vectors, spans, and basis
- Linear transformations and matrices
- Determinants, inverses, and null space
- Eigenvectors and eigenvalues
- Abstract vector spaces

### Part 2: Computational Methods
Lessons 17-24 cover computational techniques:
- Row reduction and echelon forms
- Orthogonality and Gram-Schmidt
- Least squares and SVD
- Symmetric and positive definite matrices

### Part 3: MI-Focused Essentials
Lessons 25-33 focus on concepts essential for mechanistic interpretability:
- Projections and norms
- Spectral theorem and pseudoinverse
- Low-rank approximation and PCA
- Matrix calculus for ML

Lesson 34 (optional) covers iterative and randomized methods.
